By pursuing optimal tax and spending policies, governments navigate the omnipresent trade-off s between equity and effi ciency. Of course, in practice, the process by which policies are adopted does not resemble the planner’s problem in social choice theory. In addition, real fi scal policies do not look much like the recommendations that arise from the optimal tax literature. Governments operate in public choice environments that are not conducive to focused remedying of market failure, and they suff er from their own tendencies to fail to achieve their objectives. Nevertheless, many of the tools are in place to help the federal and state governments focus tax and spending in ways that can maximize public value.","2014","2017-04-06 01:20:08","2017-04-06 14:43:23","2017-04-06 01:20:08","519–526","","4","74","","","Creating public value with tax and spending policies","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","C:\Users\DurfTop\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\m01ifjna.default\zotero\storage\7W4XV3NV\Kalambokidis-2014-Public_Administration_Review.pdf","","public finance; social welfare function; tax; Taxation; tax policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By restricting Ote analysis to Hu margin it is shown thatboth areas ambehandledby the same method. In both areas, there is a need to d^ne social distributional loeights and to evaluate the Marginal Efficiency Cost cf Public Funds (MECF). It is suggested thd the social distributional weig^ be derived from popular inequality indices. Sudi derivar tion enables the decomposition of Hie impact of the project (tax reform) on growth and redistribution so that one can evaluate Ou trade-off between the two.","2003","2017-04-06 14:11:03","2017-04-06 14:12:10","","","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\DurfTop\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\m01ifjna.default\zotero\storage\IU6RD5B6\ContentServer (7).pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
